                <strong className="font-bold">YOBBO</strong> is a collection of
                7000 distinct 3D voxel Characters that exist on the Ethereum
                Blockchain. YOBBO holders can take part in special activities
                like NFT claims, raffles, community giveaways, and play to earn
                rewards using their unique ERC721 Characters and more. Keep in
                mind, all YOBBO are awesome, but some are just cooler than the
                rest.

            <>
                A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital identity stored
                on a blockchain and used to verify ownership and authenticity.
                It cannot be copied, substituted, or divided. The ownership of
                an NFT is recorded on the blockchain and may be transferred by
                the owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded.

                Every <strong>YOBBO</strong> is unique, both in terms of
                metadata and appearance. However, certain YOBBO are far more
                rare than others. When it comes to YOBBO coin, the rarer the
                YOBBO, the higher the potential payout.

        Answer: () => (
            <>
                Each <strong>YOBBO</strong> begins with the selection of a
                class, and then iteratively selects the qualities suited for
                that class from the available alternatives. The data is then
                compared to all other YOBBO to confirm its uniqueness.

                The YOBBO contract has a Provenance Hash, which is a SHA-256
                calculated from all YOBBO metadata, models, and images prior to
